# leaflet-challenge

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to the Leaflet challenge from Module 15. The goal of the challenge was to visualize earthquake data on an interactive map using the Leaflet.js library. The project demonstrates how to fetch earthquake data, display it on the map, and style the map markers based on the magnitude of the earthquakes. The solution utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the interactive web application. 

## Description of Files
The project is organized into the following folders and files:
- `js/`: contains the JavaScript file`(logic.js)` that holds the logic for fetching earthquake data and rending it on the map
- `css/`: contains the `style.css` file for custom styling and map design
- `index.html`: the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web application, including references to the necessary external libraries and scripts
